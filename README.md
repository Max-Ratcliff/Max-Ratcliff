I am an Applied Mathematics and Computer Science student at UC Santa Cruz with a strong foundation in scientific computing, machine learning, and software engineering. My technical expertise includes C, C++, Java, Python, MATLAB, Fortran 90, and RISCV, with some experience in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am passionate about leveraging computational mathematics and AI to solve real-world problems.

Currently, I am a Resident Assistant and Research Assistant at UCSC, where I mentor students, conduct research on AI-powered learning tools, and explore knowledge gaps in foundational calculus education. Additionally, I am a SciAI Scholar at Cornell, working on applying ML techniques in scientific computing.

My projects range from developing expression parsers and matrix calculators to AI-driven scheduling tools. I am also building a portfolio website to showcase my work and skills.
